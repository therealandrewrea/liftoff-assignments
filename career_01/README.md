Name, Date, Time, and Topic:
Code and hangout @CET, 11/10, 6:00pm Pinarello Room, General Coding Workshop shared time/discussion.

Brief Description of preliminary research:

Working on the MVC structure of my app, confirming what is passed through model.  Locking in features and front end interactions.

Questions for Meetup:

Integrating Google Maps API?

Javascript on front end v Bootstrap?

Best first steps on a project/planning/initial steps?

Next Steps for continuing:

JS gives you way more integration options and complexity - bootstrap is just super quick.  

Google Maps API - static is simplest and meets my needs - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/
